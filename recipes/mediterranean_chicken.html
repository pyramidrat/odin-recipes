  <img src="../images/mediterranean_chicken.jpg" width="350"/>
  <h2>Description.</h2>
  <p>A simple (probably, I am not a  cook yet) and healthy (also not a doctor) recipe. The recipe and the cooking steps are taken in their entirety from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15486/mediterranean-chicken/">Allrecipes</a>.</p>
  <p>I has a nice taste, a good variety of vitamin-rich ingredients, and also I love chicken meat.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients.</h2>
  <ul>
  	<li>2 tablespoons white wine</li>
  	<li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
  	<li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
  	<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  	<li>½ cup diced onion</li>
  	<li>3 cups tomatoes, chopped</li>
  	<li>½ cup white wine</li>
  	<li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme</li>
  	<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
  	<li>½ cup kalamata olives</li>
  	<li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
  	<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Process.</h2>
  <h3>Step 1.</h3>
  <p>Heat white wine and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until golden, about 4 to 6 minutes on each side. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.</p>
  <h3>Step 2.</h3>
  <p>Add garlic to pan drippings; sauté for 30 seconds. Add onion; cook and stir until onions are tender, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and add 1/2 cup white wine; simmer for 10 minutes. Add thyme and basil and simmer for 5 more minutes.</p>
  <h3>Step 3.</h3>
  <p>Return chicken to skillet, cover, and cook over low heat until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside. Add olives and parsley; cook for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper and serve.</p>
